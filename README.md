# Hangman

Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts. This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

Milestone 1

In this milestone we created a built-in function which asked the user for an input, in this case a letter to be guessed. The input only had one condition, that it should be only one charatcer and if it the player uses two letters an error message would pop up.

  letter = input("Enter a single character: ")
            if len(letter) > 1:
                    print("Please, enter just one character")

Milestone 2

The main objective for Milestone 2 was to initialise the class and attributes of the programme. 

Milestone n
Continue this process for every milestone, making sure to display clear understanding of each task and the concepts behind them as well as understanding of the technologies used.

Also don't forget to include code snippets and screenshots of the system you are building, it gives proof as well as it being an easy way to evidence your experience!

Conclusions
Maybe write a conclusion to the project, what you understood about it and also how you would improve it or take it further.

Read through your documentation, do you understand everything you've written? Is everything clear and cohesive?
